Reports
==============

## Volume report
- Volume report available by senders and receivers on a daily and hourly granularity.
- These volume report can be used for server capacity planning. Usage spikes can be 
better handled by looking at these daily and hourly volume reports to understand the seasonality 
of the message volume.
  
## BCC report
- Shows the percentage of communication that went through as 'bcc'. Since slack does not have an 
equivalent message type, Slack can introduce new messaging concept 'watchers' that can be added 
by an user to keep another user in the communication loop.

## Communication outside the organization
- Shows the communication that went outside the organization (can be tracked through the domain 
of the user email id)

## Message Threads 
- Shows the top email threads with large number of exchanges. Direct messages naturally fit in 
the direct chat in slack. In case of indirect message, channel communication in slack fits 
naturally.  
 
## Frequent connections
- Shows a report of users who connect frequently. 

## Language report
- Shows the top language charsets used in the emails. This will help Slack in understanding the 
localization & language support requirements in the product

## Attachment report
- Shows the percentage of emails that carry some form of attachment.
